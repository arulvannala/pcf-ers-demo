<p>In this page we can exercise how applications in tas can use
	services. By default the applications uses H2 as an embedded database
	but it auto detects and uses any tas database bound to it.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates the tas components. We have Ops
	Manager controlling the provisioning of services where tas ERS is the
	core platform runtime services.</p>

<p>Vmware Ops manager can also provision and manage other services.
	The Service Broker components implements an tas ERS API that allows
	services to expose their catalog in the tas Marketplace where they can
	create service instances.</p>

<p>
	We understand that not all the platform services are managed by it. So
	you can implement your own Service Broker and registere with tas ERS or
	you can simply use the concpet of User Provided Services. <a
